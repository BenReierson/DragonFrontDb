# DragonFrontDb

This is your one-stop-shop for the data underlying Dragon Front, a virtual reality game from High Voltage Software. 

This .NET libary will attempt to gather all the card (and other relevant) data from the game in one place and keep it updated as the game evolves. 

#How to contribute card data
All current card data is located in the AllCards.json file. 
https://github.com/BenReierson/DragonFrontDb/blob/master/AllCards.json

Currently most cards (all but one at the time of this writing) are missing their 'flavor text', which is the secondary description text found in the game when viewing the details of a card. 

The format is very easy to understand if you open it in any text editor. Feel free to fill in the gaps or correct errors and contribute them to this repository by editing the file directly, submitting pull requests, or opening an issue. 

This library is fully free and available to use for whatever purpose you desire. It's available as a nuget here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/DragonFrontDb
